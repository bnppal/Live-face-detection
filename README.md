# Live-face-detection

So This one i created a live facedetection using opencv.
So as we know opencv has lots of pretrained classifier as for face,hand,smile etc .
So in this i used (haarcascade_frontalface_default) classifier for face to detect.


Prerequisite to run this program.
Just need a supportable pythpon ide
and make sure that opencv is installed on system 
and do make sure to import important library
after running the program the camera can be end by pressing (esc)
